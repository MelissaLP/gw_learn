## Overview

This tutorial introduces a supervised machine learning workflow for distinguishing gravitational wave (GW) signals from instrumental noise (glitches) using a neural network classifier.  In particular, we use a deep multilayer perceptron.

The focus is on intermediate-mass binary black hole (IMBH) signals, which are challenging to detect due to their short-duration signals and similarity to glitches.

## Objectives

- Understand GW detection as a multi-class classification problem.

- Train a multi-layer perceptron to classify simulated GW signals (“Injections”) vs. different glitch types.

- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.

- Explore techniques to improve performance (data scaling, architecture tuning, regularization, learning rate scheduling).
